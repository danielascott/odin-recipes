  <h2>Chef John's American Goulash</h2>

  <p>
    This is an all-time favorite dish for many people growing up when it's a
    nice cold day outside. It's warm, hearty, and always hits the spot. It's
    also very easy to make, and you can do it all in one pot.

  <div class="recipe">
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 large bay leaves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons italian seasoning</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 quart chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped italian parsley</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook
        and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent,
        about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3
        to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt,
        black pepper, and cayenne.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3
        minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water
        into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce;
        bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors
        intensify, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in
        macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about
        12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and
        parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Taste and season as desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
